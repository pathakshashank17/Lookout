    Do you zone out in the middle of your video call? Or are you super productive and want to multitask by attending call <b>and</b> doing something else? Then Lookout aims to solve this issue by providing a lookout for you (i.e. the text you specify) on Google Meet! This extension parses the captions of the call and alerts whenever someone says your defined string.
